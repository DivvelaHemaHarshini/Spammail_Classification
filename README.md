<h1>Spam Mail Classification</h1>
<h4>Overview:</h4>
<p>This project aims to classify the spam mails by using the traditional Machine learning algorithm like NaiveBayes and also uses NLP techniques for preprocessing the data
First we collect the labeled dataset consits the emails with the label 'spam' or 'ham' we preprocess the data using NLP techniques ,we use CountVectorizer for converting
the text to numerical values after that we apply naive bayes algorithm and finds the accuracy of the model</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p> 
In conclusion, email classification has challenges such as imbalanced datasets, the evolution of spam techniques,
and the need for efficient real-time processing. This calls for models that adapt continuously, using advanced techniques 
like NLP and Machine learning, with an eye on new spam </p>
